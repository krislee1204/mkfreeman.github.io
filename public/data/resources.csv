Using Storytelling to Enhance Visualizations,"The value of powerful visualization tools is lost when audiences are overwhelmed by a confusing graphical interface, even if the display is technically appropriate. As datasets become larger and require more powerful data visualizations, it is crucial that audiences are intrigued (not intimidated) by interactive visualizations. In this talk, I present a framework and specific techniques for using animation and storytelling to introduce complex visual systems to broad audiences.",http://strataconf.com/strataeu2014/public/schedule/detail/37457,imgs/divvy.png
Visualizing Models and Methods,"Dismissing the data manipulation and modeling process as too technical or unnecessary prevents decision makers from effectively leveraging their data. Communicating about data science provides a richer and more participatory understanding of data, driving better-informed decision-making. In this tutorial, we'll begin by detailing what exactly we're doing to data.",http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ny-2015/public/schedule/detail/43275,imgs/divvy.png
